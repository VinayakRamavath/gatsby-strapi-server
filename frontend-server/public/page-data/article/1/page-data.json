Two digits (unless you scored 100%) summed up your educational performance for one full year! \n\nNow that school is over, there are no more mark sheets to bother about for most of us. However, there is another scorecard that impacts your life in several ways, without you even realising.\n\nCredit score is an oft-repeated term you must have heard innumerable times. But what really does credit score mean is not something everybody understands.\n\nUnderstanding Your Credit Score\nSimply put, your credit score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and financial behaviour and is based on your credit report, which can be compared to your financial report card. \n\nIn India, a personâ€™s credit score ranges between 300 and 900, and an individual with a higher credit score is considered to be more creditworthy and financially responsible.\n\nWho Calculates Your Credit Score?\nIn case you are wondering, your credit score is based on your credit report, which is a record of all your financial transactions, including any debts, repayments, and utility bills, collected and maintained by various credit bureaus approved by the RBI. \n\nIn India, there are four main credit bureaus, including the Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited or CIBIL, which was the first credit bureau to be established in India. The other three main credit bureaus in the country are Equifax, Experian and CRIF High Mark.","published_at":"2020-03-11","image":{"publicURL":"/static/3da3774a7cd30db8734f00f29c35a859-149b7e73cea3f76363cee22cfb20c329.jpeg"}}},"pageContext":{"id":1}}}
